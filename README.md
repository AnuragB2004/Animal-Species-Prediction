# Animal Species Detection Using AI

This project focuses on the use of Artificial Intelligence to detect and classify different animal species in images. The implementation is based on Google Colab and written in Python.

## Overview

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image recognition techniques to accurately identify various animal species from input images. By employing transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models, the system can effectively discern different species even in complex backgrounds.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Google Colab

## Setup

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/animal-species-detection.git
   ```
2. Open the `Animal_Species_Detection.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and perform animal species detection.

## Usage

- Upload the images you want to analyze to the designated folder.
- Execute the code cells in the notebook to preprocess the data and train the model.
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Results

The model demonstrates robust performance in accurately identifying various animal species, achieving an average accuracy rate of X%. Specific results and accuracy rates for different animal categories are available in the project report.
